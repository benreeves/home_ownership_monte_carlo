# Does it make sense to buy a house?

Everyone has an opinion. Convention seems to be "yes", except for those who say "wait - what about the opportunity 
cost of not investing in the stock market?"

Some tools have decent back of the envelop calculations which can give some insight on the relative end of term
market value difference from renting vs buying

This is a simple simulation tool that lets you put in some assumptions around stock market returns, salary growth, 
home appreciation, expenses, etc and it will run Monte Carlo simulations to try and quantify the relative risk and return
with ownership vs renting.

Long story short - it depends. For families, it seems to make sense since the renting costs are so much
higher for a single family home. For individuals, it can make sense if you keep well within your budget and then allocate
all your extra capital towards public markets (stocks and bonds)
